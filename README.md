# Push-Swap-Visualizer
This tool brings the Push Swap algorithm to life, making it easier to understand how it works.
Push Swap is a program that takes a list of numbers and sorts them using a specific set of instructions. 
This visualizer allows you to see those instructions play out in real time, helping you grasp the logic behind the algorithm.


## What is Push Swap?
Push Swap is a project at 42 School that challenges you to sort a list of numbers using only a specific set of "operations" on two stacks, A and B. Ô∏è

## How does this visualizer help?
This visualizer offers three essential tools to help you master Push Swap:
#### 1. Random Number Generator:
- Generate consecutive numbers within a specified range (min and max).
- Generate random numbers within a specified range.

#### 2. Stack Visualizer:
See in real-time how operations affect the contents and order of elements in stacks A and B.
Understand the flow of the sorting process visually.

#### 3. Stack Viewer:
- Enter a list of numbers and a sequence of operations.
- Step through each operation one by one.
- Observe the changes in the stacks after each step.
- Debug your own Push Swap implementations by comparing expected behavior.

## Benefits
- Learn and visualize the Push Swap algorithm step-by-step.
- Experiment with different sorting strategies by generating varied input data.
- Gain deeper understanding of the logic behind each operation.
- Debug your own implementations by comparing to the visualizer's results.
